- Building and running your first pipeline
- Using Groovy scripts in pipelines

**Day 3: Advanced Pipeline Concepts**
- Parallel and sequential stages
- Conditional execution
- Handling errors and exceptions
- Using environment variables in pipelines

**Day 4: Jenkins Pipeline Plugins**
- Overview of pipeline-related plugins
- Integrating source code repositories (Git, SVN)
- Artifacts management with Jenkins
- Using Docker and containers in pipelines

**Day 5: Jenkins Pipeline Best Practices**
